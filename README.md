## Purpose of this document

The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it is intended as a public resource for those seeking an overview of current voting theory and electronic voting literature, particularly where these ideas may apply to problems in blockchain-based social coordination. Additionally, this repository will serve as a research archive, used to inform the design of a system for democratic governance within the open source coin protocol.
